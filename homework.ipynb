    "In the given assignment, you are required to write **Python (v3) code** for a client program and establish successful communication with the server, which runs on the **IP 160.75.154.73**. Client program should contain two distinct phases in order to execute the communication successfully. First, it should authenticate itself to the server and then server is going to send a series of questions in the context of “Guess the Word” game and client program should provide the sufficient interface to a user to play the game. Details of the implementation are given below.  "

    "### Part 1.  Authentication Mechanism (30 pt)\n",
    "An e-mail, which contains a unique **hexKey** has been sent to each student. In the following authentication mechanism, every student should use her/his own unique in order to authenticate herself/himself. Before further detail about the mechanism, we will briefly describe the main purpose of the authentication protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (Note: If you have not received your key information, please contact T.A.s Talip Tolga Sari – sarita@itu.edu.tr and Mertkan Akkoç – akkocm@itu.edu.tr)\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Preliminary Information about Authentication \n",
    "The main objective of an authentication is to prevent anyone from imitating you by using your unique information. Simply assigning unique IDs and password for users to be used in authentication is not an efficient solution for computer networks. Because, anyone who listens (or shares) the same communication medium could obtain your id and password information to use them later in order to imitate you. Thus, in any secure communication protocol, users should avoid transmitting their critical information without an encryption mechanism to keep their identities safe. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the given motivation described above, you need to avoid sending your unique **hexKey** plainly over the network. To encrypt your unique key, **sha1** hashing mechanism is going to be used in this project. You can implement your own sha1 or use an external library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the defined protocol, first, you need to initialize a TCP connection with the **port numbered 1773 of the server, which runs on 160.75.154.73**. Then, client program should send the following string to initiate the protocol **“Start_Connection”**. After receiving the start command, the server is going to send a random hex string **(randomHex)**. Client program is going to concatenate its unique **hexKey** and the received **randomHex** to create a string of hex which contains 64 chars. This string will be used as the input of sha1 hashing function to create a hash of the data. The sha1 function is going to return a byte stream with size of 20 bytes. Conversion to hex is going to expand the size of the stream to 40 chars. You are going to use this char array to authenticate yourself to the server. However, lastly, you should add your student Id to the end of the stream by using ‘#’ symbol between them. Thus, you will send a char array to the server with the size of 50 chars (40 sha1 result + 1 ‘#’ symbol + 9 student ID ). If the calculation and the transmission are successful, server is going to send to a message which informs you that you have successfully authenticated yourself and ask you whether you wish to proceed the second part or not. After receiving this message, the authentication part of the project is completed. Figure 1 shows the interactions between the client and the server during the authentication phase.\n",
